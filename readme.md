# Modeling cell to cell interaction with Graph neural network

C2CGNN is intended to model temporal biomarker activity of a single cell based on its neighbors activity profile. The model modifies ASTGNN, Attention-based spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network, originally designed to model traffic across different stops. While modified version retains the spatiotemporal aspect, it allows for dynamic relationships between the neighboring cells unlike in the original ASTGNN.
